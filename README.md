## What is this?

A small set of scripts used to unpack and merge N gpx files into a single video.

## Why?

I wanted to plot all of the runs I did over 2 years while living in San Francisco.

## Pre-reqs

Tech: Python and quite a few other things.  
Data: Strava Export or a folder and date that replicate it. Specifically an activities csv, and folder of activities (.gpx, .fit. tcx).

## Data formats

Activities must be either a .gpx, .fit, .tcx, or one a zipped version of the prior.
